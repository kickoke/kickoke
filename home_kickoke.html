			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Hi, I'm Tina Lüdtke! <br />
				My journey as a communicator began in seventh grade when I was writing
				articles for my high school's website. We were a small group of writers
				supported by some students that took care of the backend and the CMS.
				During our sessions, I often wondered about the inner workings of a
				website. However, I was told to write and I could not do both tech and
				writing.<br />
				Fast forward a few years - Turns out that I can do both. I studied
				technical writing to nurture my curiosity for tech and learn to
				communicate effectively. My favorite technical communication topics are
				content strategy, video documentation, and metadata.<br />
				I graduated in December 2020, and continue to learn and grow. Currently,
				I learn Javascript. I am convinced that my communication skills will
				benefit from coding, as analytical thinking is the cornerstone to
				creating audience-appropriate content.

				During my course of study, I learned to communicate with different
				audiences across multiple channels and media. Have a look at the
				projects I am most proud of below.

				<h3>Introducing Video Documentation at Bosch Building Technologies</h3>
				<p>
					During an internship at Bosch Building Technologies (BT), I introduced
					a new form of documentation: How-to videos for CCTV management
					software.

				<h3>
					Improving Documentation with User Tests at Bosch Building Technologies
				</h3>
				<p>
					Since the on-screen documentation was published in a deprecated
					format, Bosch BT needed to switch to HTML5-based help. To improve the
					usability of the new help, I conducted a user test.

				<h3>Blog Article for KnowledgeOwl</h3>
				<p>
					I delivered a lightning talk about how humans process information and
					how technical writers can act on that at Write the Docs Prague 2020.
					Due to the great reception, KnowledgeOwl, a company that builds
					knowledge base software, asked me to create an article for their blog.
