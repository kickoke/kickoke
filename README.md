### Hi there 👋

I'm Tina, a technical writer based in the heart of Silicon Valley.

I am passionate about:
- 💡 Good usability (that goes for the product **and** the docs).
- ♻️ Creating content economically be reusing content and working in a single source of truth.
- 💬 Using knowledge graphs to distribute personalized information at the right time, in the right context. If you are working on a solution like this and need a docs head, let me know. 

For work samples, check out my [Portfolio](https://kickoke.com/).
